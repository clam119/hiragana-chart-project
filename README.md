# Hi, Thank You For Checking Out This Mini Project - Hiragana Chart Project

## About This Project:

What the application does: This is a simple static application whereby you press one of the Hiragana Buttons and the corresponding audio for that button will be played. 

Motivation Behind Creation: I designed this in tandem with the initial Drum-Kit-Project to understand more about the DOM and adding EventListeners with JavaScript. 
I thought creating a Japanese Hiragana Chart with the corresponding audio files would be a fun twist because I'm enthusiastic about Japan & Japanese.
